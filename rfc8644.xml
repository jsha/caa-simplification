<section anchor="introduction" title="Introduction">

<t>The Certification Authority Authorization (CAA) DNS Resource Record
allows a DNS domain name holder to specify the Certification
Authorities (CAs) authorized to issue certificates for that domain name.
Publication of CAA Resource Records allows a public CA to implement additional controls to reduce the risk of
unintended certificate mis-issue.</t>

<t>Like the TLSA record defined in DNS-Based Authentication of Named
Entities (DANE) <xref target="RFC6698"/>, CAA records are used as a part of a
mechanism for checking PKIX <xref target="RFC6698"/> certificate data.  The distinction
between the two specifications is that CAA records specify an
authorization control to be performed by a certificate issuer before
issuing a certificate and TLSA records specify a verification
control to be performed by a relying party after the certificate is
issued.

<!-- [rfced] Section 1:  Does "two specifications" refer to DANE and
PKIX, or something else?

Original:
 The
 distinction between the two specifications is that CAA records
 specify an authorization control to be performed by a certificate
 issuer before issue of a certificate and TLSA records specify a
 verification control to be performed by a relying party after the
 certificate is issued. -->

</t>

<t>Conformance with a published CAA record is a necessary, but not
sufficient, condition for the issuance of a certificate.</t>

<t>Criteria for the inclusion of embedded trust anchor certificates in
applications are outside the scope of this document.  Typically, such
criteria require the CA to publish a Certification Practices Statement
(CPS) that specifies how the requirements of the Certificate Policy
(CP) are achieved.  It is also common for a CA to engage an
independent third-party auditor to prepare an annual audit statement
of its performance against its CPS.</t>

<t>A set of CAA records describes only current grants of authority to
issue certificates for the corresponding DNS domain name.  Since
certificates are valid for a period of time, it is possible
that a certificate that is not conformant with the CAA records
currently published was conformant with the CAA records published at
the time that the certificate was issued.  Relying parties MUST
NOT use CAA records as part of certificate validation.</t>

<t>CAA records MAY be used by Certificate Evaluators as a possible
indicator of a security policy violation.  Such use SHOULD take into
account the possibility that published CAA records changed between
the time a certificate was issued and the time at which the
certificate was observed by the Certificate Evaluator.</t>

<t>Because the presence of an issue Property Tag in the Relevant RRSet

Issuer.</t>

<t>An issue Property Tag where the issue-value does not match the ABNF
grammar MUST be treated the same as one specifying an empty issuer&nbhy;domain-name. For
example, the following malformed CAA RRSet forbids issuance:</t>

<figure><artwork><![CDATA[
malformed.example.com     CAA 0 issue "%%%%%"

<t>CAA authorizations are additive; thus, the result of specifying both
an empty issuer-domain-name and a non-empty issuer-domain-name  is the
same as specifying just the non-empty issuer-domain-name.

<t>An Issuer MAY choose to specify parameters that further
constrain the issue of certificates by that Issuer -- for example,
specifying that certificates are to be subject to specific validation
policies, billed to certain accounts, or issued under specific trust
anchors.</t>

<t>For example, if ca1.example.net has requested that its customer
accountable.example.com specify their account number "230123" in each
of the customer's CAA records using the (CA-defined) "account" parameter,
it would look like this:</t>

<figure><artwork><![CDATA[
accountable.example.com   CAA 0 issue "ca1.example.net; account=230123"

<t>The semantics of parameters to the issue Property Tag are determined by
the Issuer alone.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="caa-issuewild-property" title="CAA issuewild Property">

<t>The issuewild Property Tag has the same syntax and semantics as the issue
Property Tag except that it only grants authorization to
issue certificates that specify a Wildcard Domain Name and each issuewild
Property takes precedence over each issue Property when specified.

is to reduce the risk of certificate mis-issue rather than avoid
reliance on a certificate that has been mis-issued.  DANE <xref target="RFC6698"/>
describes a mechanism for avoiding reliance on mis-issued
certificates.</t>

<section anchor="use-of-dns-security" title="Use of DNS Security">

<t>The use of DNSSEC to authenticate CAA RRs is strongly RECOMMENDED but not
required.  An Issuer MUST NOT issue certificates if doing so would
conflict with the Relevant RRSet, irrespective of
whether the corresponding DNS records are signed.</t>

<t>DNSSEC provides a proof of non-existence for both DNS Fully&nbsp;Qualified Domain Names and
RRSets within FQDNs.  DNSSEC verification thus enables an Issuer to
determine whether the answer to a CAA record query (1)&nbsp;is empty because
the RRSet is empty or (2)&nbsp;is non-empty but the response has been
suppressed.</t>

<t>The use of DNSSEC allows an Issuer to acquire and archive a proof that
they were authorized to issue certificates for the FQDN.
Verification of such archives may be an audit requirement to verify
CAA record-processing compliance.  Publication of such archives may
be a transparency requirement to verify CAA record-processing
compliance.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="non-compliance-by-certification-authority" title="Non-compliance by Certification Authority">

<t>CAA records offer CAs a cost-effective means of mitigating the risk
of certificate mis-issue: the cost of implementing CAA checks is very
small, and the potential costs of a mis-issue event include the
removal of an embedded trust anchor.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="mis-issue-by-authorized-certification-authority" title="Mis-Issue by Authorized Certification Authority">

<t>The use of CAA records does not prevent mis-issue by an authorized
CA, i.e., a CA that is authorized to issue
certificates for the FQDN in question by CAA records.</t>

<t>FQDN holders SHOULD verify that the CAs they authorize to
issue certificates for their FQDNs employ appropriate controls to
ensure that certificates are issued only to authorized parties within
their organization.</t>

<t>Such controls are most appropriately determined by the FQDN
holder and the authorized CA(s) directly and are thus outside the scope of
this document.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="suppression-or-spoofing-of-caa-records" title="Suppression or Spoofing of CAA Records">

<t>Suppression of a CAA record or insertion of a bogus CAA record
could enable an attacker to obtain a certificate from an Issuer that
was not authorized to issue for an affected FQDN.</t>

<t>Where possible, Issuers SHOULD perform DNSSEC validation to detect
missing or modified CAA record sets.</t>

<t>In cases where DNSSEC is not deployed for a corresponding FQDN, an
Issuer SHOULD attempt to mitigate this risk by employing appropriate
DNS security controls.  For example, all portions of the DNS lookup
process SHOULD be performed against the authoritative nameserver.
Data cached by third parties MUST NOT be relied on as the sole source of DNS CAA
information but MAY be used to
support additional anti&nbhy;spoofing or anti-suppression controls.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="denial-of-service" title="Denial of Service">

<t>Introduction of a malformed or malicious CAA RR could, in theory,
enable a Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack. This could happen by modification of
authoritative DNS records or by spoofing inflight DNS responses.</t>

<t>This specific threat is not considered to add significantly to the
risk of running an insecure DNS service.</t>

<t>An attacker could, in principle, perform a DoS attack against an
Issuer by requesting a certificate with a maliciously long DNS name.
In practice, the DNS protocol imposes a maximum name length, and CAA
processing does not exacerbate the existing need to mitigate DoS
attacks to any meaningful degree.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="abuse-of-the-critical-flag" title="Abuse of the Critical Flag">

<t>A CA could make use of the critical flag to
trick customers into publishing records that prevent competing CAs
from issuing certificates even though the
customer intends to authorize multiple providers. This could happen if the
customers were setting CAA records based on data provided by the CA rather than
generating those records themselves.</t>

<t>In practice, such an attack would be of minimal effect, since any
competent competitor that found itself unable to issue certificates
due to lack of support for a Property marked critical should
investigate the cause and report the reason to the customer.  The
customer will thus discover that they had been deceived.</t>

</section>
</section>
<section anchor="deployment-considerations" title="Deployment Considerations">

<t>A CA implementing CAA may find that they receive errors looking up CAA records.
The following are some common causes of such errors, so that CAs may provide
guidance to their subscribers on fixing the underlying problems.</t>

<section anchor="blocked-queries-or-responses" title="Blocked Queries or Responses">

<t>Some middleboxes -- in particular, anti-DDoS appliances -- may be configured to
drop DNS packets of unknown types, or they may start dropping such packets when
they consider themselves under attack. This generally manifests as a timed-out
DNS query or as a SERVFAIL at a local recursive resolver.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="rejected-queries-and-malformed-responses" title="Rejected Queries and Malformed Responses">

<t>Some authoritative nameservers respond with REJECTED or NOTIMP when queried
for an RR type they do not recognize. At least one authoritative
resolver produces a malformed response (with the QR (Query/Response) bit set to "0") when queried
for unknown RR types.  Per RFC 1034, the correct response for
unknown RR types is NOERROR.

<!-- [rfced] Section 6.2:  Please let us know if any updates are
needed regarding the following:

a) For ease of the reader, we changed "QR bit" to QR (Query/Response)
bit."  Please let us know if this is incorrect.

b) We could not find any mention of "NOERROR" in RFC 1034 (but we see
"A name error (NE)").  Will this sentence be clear to readers?

Original:
 At least
 one authoritative resolver produces a malformed response (with the QR
 bit set to 0) when queried for unknown Resource Record types.  Per
 RFC 1034, the correct response for unknown Resource Record types is
 NOERROR.

Currently:
 At least one
 authoritative resolver produces a malformed response (with the QR
 (Query/Response) bit set to "0") when queried for unknown RR types.
 Per RFC 1034, the correct response for unknown RR types is NOERROR. -->

</section>
<section anchor="delegation-to-private-nameservers" title="Delegation to Private Nameservers">

<t>Some FQDN administrators make the contents of a subdomain unresolvable on the
public Internet by delegating that subdomain to a nameserver whose IP address is
private. A CA processing CAA records for such subdomains will receive
SERVFAIL from its recursive resolver. The CA MAY interpret that as preventing
issuance. FQDN administrators wishing to issue certificates for private
FQDNs SHOULD use split-horizon DNS with a publicly available nameserver, so
that CAs can receive a valid, empty CAA response for those FQDNs.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="bogus-dnssec-responses" title="Bogus DNSSEC Responses">

<t>Queries for CAA RRs are different from most DNS RR&nbsp;types, because
a signed, empty response to a query for CAA RRs is meaningfully different
from a bogus response. A signed, empty response indicates that there is
definitely no CAA policy set at a given label. A bogus response may mean
either a misconfigured zone or an attacker tampering with records. DNSSEC
implementations may have bugs with signatures on empty responses that go
unnoticed, because for more common RR types like A and AAAA,
the difference to an end user between empty and bogus is irrelevant; they
both mean a site is unavailable.</t>

<t>In particular, at least two authoritative resolvers that implement live signing
had bugs when returning empty RRsets for DNSSEC-signed zones, in
combination with mixed-case queries. Mixed&nbhy;case queries, also known as DNS 0x20,
are used by some recursive resolvers to increase resilience against DNS
poisoning attacks. DNSSEC-signing authoritative resolvers are expected to copy
the same capitalization from the query into their ANSWER section but also to sign the
response as if they had used all lowercase. In particular, PowerDNS versions
prior to 4.0.4 had this bug.</t>

<section anchor="differences-versus-rfc6844" title="Differences from RFC 6844">

<t>This document obsoletes RFC 6844. The most important change is to
the "Certification Authority Processing" section (now called
"Relevant Resource Record Set," as noted below). RFC 6844 specified an
algorithm that performed DNS tree-climbing not only on the FQDN
being processed but also on all CNAMEs and DNAMEs encountered along
the way. This made the processing algorithm very inefficient when used
on FQDNs that utilize many CNAMEs and would have made it difficult
for hosting providers to set CAA policies on their own FQDNs without
setting potentially unwanted CAA policies on their customers' FQDNs.
This document specifies a simplified processing algorithm that only
performs tree-climbing on the FQDN being processed, and it leaves the
processing of CNAMEs and DNAMEs up to the CA's recursive resolver.</t>

<t>This document also includes a "Deployment Considerations" section
detailing experience gained with practical deployment of CAA enforcement
among CAs in the WebPKI.</t>

<t>This document clarifies the ABNF grammar for the issue and issuewild tags
and resolves some inconsistencies with the document text. In particular,
it specifies that parameters are separated with semicolons. It also allows
hyphens in Property Tags.</t>

<t>This document also clarifies the processing of a CAA RRset that is not empty
but that does not contain any issue or issuewild tags.</t>

<t>This document removes the section titled "The CAA RR Type," merging it with
"Mechanism" because the definitions were mainly duplicates. It moves the "Use of
DNS Security" section into Security Considerations. It renames "Certification
Authority Processing" to "Relevant Resource Record Set" and emphasizes the use
of that term to more clearly define which domains are affected by a given RRset.</t>
